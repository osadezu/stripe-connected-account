# Stripe Connected Accounts

Simple React application to create Stripe connected accounts

### üèó Under Development üöß


## Considerations

- For simplicity, this repository contains the directories for both front-end and back-end of the task application. In a larger application it might make more sense to have separate repositorires for each part of the application.

## Installation

### Back-End

1. After cloning this repository locally, change to `server/` directory and run:

```
npm install
```

2. Provide the [Stripe API Secret Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) as environment variables. The application can load the test and live keys from these .env files respectively:

```
# .env.development.local
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_*****

# .env.production.local
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_*****
```

## About Dependencies

### Front-end

- **[dotenv-flow](https://github.com/kerimdzhanov/dotenv-flow)**: extends [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv), used to separate secrets into `.env.local` while keeping `.env` file tracked in version control.
- **[nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)**: this development restarts the application automatically after changes are detected in the code, simplifying the development process.

### Back-end

- **[axios](https://axios-http.com/)**: an http client that simplifies the operation of fetching data from an API.
